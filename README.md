## Array

### [667. Beautiful Arrangement II](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/description/)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def constructArray(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        nums = [1] * n
        
        diff = k
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            if i % 2 == 1:
                nums[i] = nums[i-1] + diff
            else:
                nums[i] = nums[i-1] - diff
            diff -= 1
        for i in range(k+1, n):
            nums[i] = (i+1)
                
        return nums
```
We firstly satisfy the condition of k different differences. Then we append rest of numbers.


## Backtracking
### [526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement/description/)
```python
class Solution(object):
    def countArrangement(self, N):
        """
        :type N: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        def count(i,X):
            if i == 1:
                return 1
            
            return sum(count(i-1,X-{x}) for x in X if x % i == 0 or i % x == 0)
        return count(N, set(range(1,N+1)))
                
```
Trick: lower ith is likely to contain "beautiful" value, so we run backwards so we can eliminate "unbeautiful" chains faster. This makes our search space smaller.
